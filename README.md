# project

Welcome to Quinzical. Type ./quinzical.sh in the terminal to get started. Once you see the GUI, play around with it and enjoy the game.

To add extra questions or categories, simply visit either the categories folder or categoriesInternational folder to add NZ or world questions, respectively. Inside the folders are categories, simply click on the one you wan to modify and enter it with the following format: question|clue|answer. You may also include / in the answers. eg red/orange to signify multiple correct answers. In this case, both red or orange are valid.

Finally, there is an international section which will be unlocked in the games modules once two sections have been completed.
